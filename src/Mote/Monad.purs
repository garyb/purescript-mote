-- | The main `MoteT` / `Mote` monadic DSL used to describe tests and groups of
-- | tests.
-- |
-- | After description via this DSL a `Plan` can be generated, that can then
-- | finally be interpreted into some target monad.
-- |
-- | - The `bracket` type represents a type of kind `Type -> Type` kind in which
-- |   bracketing can be dealt with. This type is higher kinded as the "before"
-- |   part of a bracket is expressed by a type like `bracket r`, so that the
-- |   "after" part can consume it as `r -> bracket Unit` later. If bracketing
-- |   is not required, setting this to `Const Void` is a good way to
-- |   communicate that it is unused/unusable.
-- | - The `test` type represents the type of tests. The kind here is only
-- |   required to be `Type` but will usually be something like `m Unit` (where
-- |   `m` here is some monad to run the tests in, not the `m` of `MoteT`).
-- | - The `m` is an underlying monad that can be used to perform effects while
-- |   constructing the test suite. This allows for tests to be generated from
-- |   the filesystem, reading from a `Reader`-based environment, etc.
-- |
-- | The `bracket` and `test` types are separated to allow for tests and
-- | bracketing to have different constraints and capabilities. In some cases
-- | it might be desirable to run tests with an alternative `Reader`, or
-- | restrict the kind of effects tests are allowed to perform compared with
-- | the bracketing code.
newtype MoteT bracket test m a = MoteT (WriterT (Array (Description bracket test)) m a)

-- | A non-effectful version of `MoteT`. This is for cases where groups and
-- | tests can be described purely.
